---

When it comes to testing Java EE applications, there's a wide spectrum of tools and approaches at our disposal.
Depending on the specific goals and requirements of a given test, options range from
plain unit tests of single classes to comprehensive integration tests deployed into a container (e.g. via http://arquillian.org/[Arquillian])
and driven through tools such as http://rest-assured.io/[REST Assured].

In this post I'd like to discuss one testing approach which represents some kind of a middle ground:
launching a local CDI container and a JPA runtime, connected to an in-memory database.
That way you can test CDI beans (e.g. containing business logic) in conjunction with the persistence layer (e.g. JPA-based repositories) under plain Java SE.

This allows to test individual classes and components as they interact with others
(e.g. without mocking of repositories when testing the business logic),
while still benefitting from fast execution times (no container management/deployment and remote API calls needed).
The approach also allows tests around services our application might rely on, such as interceptors, transactional semantics and other things
that'd otherwise require deployment into a container.
Finally, these tests are easy to debug, as everything runs in the local VM and no remote processes are involved.

To make the approach worthwhile, the following requirements should be satisfied by the testing infrastructure:

* Allow to obtain CDI beans via dependency injection, with support for all the CDI goodness such as interceptors, decorators, events etc.
* Allow to obtain a JPA entity manager via dependency injection
* Allow to use dependency injection in JPA entity listeners
* Allow to use declarative transaction control via `@Transactional`
* Allow to use transactional event observers (e.g. event observers running after transaction completion)

In the following let's see how these requirements can be addressed.
You can find a complete version of the shown code in the Hibernate https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-demos/tree/master/other/cdi-jpa-testing[examples repository] on GitHub.
That example project uses https://weld.cdi-spec.org/[Weld] as the CDI container, https://hibernate.org/orm/[Hibernate ORM] as the JPA provider and http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] as a database.
Note the post is mostly interested in the interaction of CDI and the persistence layer, you could also use this approach with any other database such as Postgres or MySQL.

== Obtaining CDI Beans via Dependency Injection

Firing up a CDI container under Java SE is trivial using the http://www.cdi-spec.org/news/2017/05/15/CDI_2_is_released/[bootstrap API] standardized in CDI 2.0.
So we could simply go and use that API in our tests.
One alternative to consider is https://github.com/weld/weld-junit[Weld JUnit], a small extension to Weld (the CDI reference implementation) aimed at the purposes of testing.
Amongst other things, Weld JUnit allows to specify which CDI scopes should be active when invoking CDI beans during the test.
This comes in handy when testing `@RequestScoped` beans for instance.

A first simple test using Weld JUnit could look like this
(note I'm using the JUnit 4 API here, but Weld JUnit also comes with support for JUnit 5):

[source,java]
----
public class SimpleCdiTest {

    @Rule
    public WeldInitiator weld = WeldInitiator.from(GreetingService.class)
        .activate(RequestScoped.class)
        .inject(this)
        .build();

    @Inject
    private GreetingService greeter;

    @Test
    public void helloWorld() {
        assertThat(greeter.greet("Java")).isEqualTo("Hello, Java");
    }
}
----

== Obtaining a JPA Entity Manager via Dependency Injection

In the next step let's see how we can obtain an JPA entity manager via dependency injection.
Usually you'd obtain such reference using the `@PersistenceContext` annotation
(and indeed Weld JUnit provides a way to enable that),
but for the sake of consistency with other injection points I prefer to obtain entity managers via `@Inject` as defined by https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330[JSR 330]
(also this allows for constructor injection instead of field injection).

To do so, we can simply define a CDI producer for `EntityManagerFactory` like this:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class EntityManagerFactoryProducer {

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    public EntityManagerFactory produceEntityManagerFactory() {
        return Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myPu", new HashMap<>());
    }

    public void close(@Disposes EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory) {
        entityManagerFactory.close();
    }
}
----

This uses the JPA bootstrap API to build an (application-scoped) entity manager factory.
In a similar way, a request-scoped entity manager bean can be produced:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class EntityManagerProducer {

    @Inject
    private EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory;

    @Produces
    @RequestScoped
    public EntityManager produceEntityManager() {
        return entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
    }

    public void close(@Disposes EntityManager entityManager) {
        entityManager.close();
    }
}
----

Note that you'd have to register these beans as https://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/specialization.html[alternatives] in case you already had such producers in your main code.

With the producers in place, we can inject an entity manager into CDI beans via `@Inject`:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingService {

    private final EntityManager entityManager;

    @Inject
    public TestService(EntityManager entityManager) {
        this.entityManager = entityManager;
    }

    // ...
}
----

== Dependency Injection in JPA Entity Listeners

JPA 2.1 introduced support for CDI within JPA entity listeners.
For this to work, the JPA provider (e.g. Hibernate ORM) must have a reference to the current CDI bean manager.

In an application server such as http://wildfly.org/[WildFly], the container would do that wiring automatically for us.
For our test set-up, we need to pass the bean manager reference ourselves when bootstrapping JPA.
Luckily, that's not too complicated; in the entity manager factory producer we can obtain a `BeanManager` instance via `@Inject` and then pass it on to JPA using the "javax.persistence.bean.manager" property key:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class EntityManagerFactoryProducer {

    @Inject
    private BeanManager beanManager;

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    public EntityManagerFactory produceEntityManagerFactory() {
        Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
        props.put("javax.persistence.bean.manager", beanManager);
        return Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myPu", props);
    }

    public void close(@Disposes EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory) {
        entityManagerFactory.close();
    }
}
----

This lets use make use of dependency injection within JPA entity listeners:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class SomeListener {

    private final GreetingService greetingService;

    @Inject
    public SomeListener(GreetingService greetingService) {
        this.greetingService = greetingService;
    }

    @PostPersist public void onPostPersist(TestEntity entity) {
        greetingService.greet(entity.getName());
    }
}
----

== Declarative Transaction Control via `@Transactional` and transactional event observers

The last missing piece to satisfy our original requirements is support for the `@Transactional` annotation and transactional event observers.
This one is a bit more complex to tackle, as it requires the integration of a transaction manager compatible with JTA (the Java Transaction API).

In the following we're going to use http://narayana.io/[Narayana] which also is the transaction manager used in WildFly.
For Narayana to work, a JNDI server is needed, from which it can obtain the JTA datasource.
Furthermore, the Weld JTA module is required.
Please refer to the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-demos/blob/master/other/cdi-jpa-testing/pom.xml[pom.xml] of the example project for exact artifact ids and versions.

With these dependencies in place, the next step is to plug in a custom `ConnectionProvider` into Hibernate ORM,
which makes sure that Hibernate ORM works with `Connection` objects that use transactions managed by Narayana.
Thankfully, my colleague Gytis Trikleris has provided https://github.com/jbosstm/quickstart/blob/master/jta-and-hibernate-standalone/src/main/java/org/jboss/narayana/quickstart/jta/TransactionalConnectionProvider.java[such implementation] already as part of the Narayana examples on GitHub.
I'm shamelessly going to copy this implementation:

[source,java]
----
public class TransactionalConnectionProvider implements ConnectionProvider {

    public static final String DATASOURCE_JNDI = "java:testDS";
    public static final String USERNAME = "sa";
    public static final String PASSWORD = "";

    private final TransactionalDriver transactionalDriver;

    public TransactionalConnectionProvider() {
        transactionalDriver = new TransactionalDriver();
    }

    public static void bindDataSource() {
        JdbcDataSource dataSource = new JdbcDataSource();
        dataSource.setURL("jdbc:h2:mem:db1;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1");
        dataSource.setUser(USERNAME);
        dataSource.setPassword(PASSWORD);

        try {
            InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext();
            initialContext.bind(DATASOURCE_JNDI, dataSource);
        }
        catch (NamingException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        properties.setProperty(TransactionalDriver.userName, USERNAME);
        properties.setProperty(TransactionalDriver.password, PASSWORD);
        return transactionalDriver.connect("jdbc:arjuna:" + DATASOURCE_JNDI, properties);
    }

    @Override
    public void closeConnection(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
        if (!connection.isClosed()) {
            connection.close();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public boolean supportsAggressiveRelease() {
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isUnwrappableAs(Class aClass) {
        return getClass().isAssignableFrom(aClass);
    }

    @Override
    public <T> T unwrap(Class<T> aClass) {
        if (isUnwrappableAs(aClass)) {
            return (T) this;
        }

        throw new UnknownUnwrapTypeException(aClass);
    }
}
----

This registers an H2 datasource with JNDI from where Narayana's `TransactionalDriver` will fetch it whenever Hibernate ORM requests a connection.
This connection will use JTA transactions, no matter whether transactions are controlled declaratively (through `@Transactional`), via an injected `UserTransaction` or using the entity manager transaction API.

In the next step that connection provider must be registered with Hibernate ORM.
This could be done in _persistence.xml_, but as this provider only should be used during testing,
a better place is our entity manager factory producer method:

[source,java]
----
@Produces
@ApplicationScoped
public EntityManagerFactory produceEntityManagerFactory() {
    Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
    props.put("javax.persistence.bean.manager", beanManager);
    props.put(Environment.CONNECTION_PROVIDER, TransactionalConnectionProvider.class);

    return Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myPu", props);
}
----

In order to hook up Weld with the transaction manager, an implementation of Weld's https://docs.jboss.org/weld/javadoc/3.0/weld-spi/index.html?org/jboss/weld/transaction/spi/TransactionServices.html[TransactionServices] SPI is needed:

[source,java]
----
public class TestingTransactionServices implements TransactionServices {

    @Override
    public void cleanup() {
    }

    @Override
    public void registerSynchronization(Synchronization synchronizedObserver) {
        jtaPropertyManager.getJTAEnvironmentBean()
            .getTransactionSynchronizationRegistry()
            .registerInterposedSynchronization(synchronizedObserver);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isTransactionActive() {
        try {
            return com.arjuna.ats.jta.UserTransaction.userTransaction().getStatus() == Status.STATUS_ACTIVE;
        }
        catch (SystemException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public UserTransaction getUserTransaction() {
        return com.arjuna.ats.jta.UserTransaction.userTransaction();
    }
}
----

This lets Weld

* register JTA synchronizations (which is used to make transactional observer methods work),
* query for the current transaction status and
* obtain the user transaction (so to enable injection of the `UserTransaction` object).

The `TransactionServices` implementation is picked up using the service loader mechanism,
so a file _META-INF/services/org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.Service_ with the fully-qualified name of our implementation as its contents is required:

[source,java]
----
org.hibernate.demos.jpacditesting.support.TestingTransactionServices
----

And with that, we can now test code like this which makes use of transactional observers:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class SomeObserver {

    public void observes(@Observes(during=TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMPLETION) String event) {
        // handle event ...
    }
}
----

We also can use JTA's `@Transactional` annotation to benefit from declarative transaction control:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class TransactionalGreetingService {

    @Transactional(TxType.REQUIRED)
    public String greet(String name) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

When this `greet()` method is invoked, it must be run in an transaction context,
which either has been started before or will be started if needed.
Now, if you have used transactional CDI beans before, you might wonder where the associated method interceptor is.
As it turns out, Narayana comes with CDI support and provides us with everything needed: method interceptors for the different transactional behaviours (`REQUIRED`, `MANDATORY` etc.)
as well as a portable extension which registers the interceptors with the CDI container.

== Configuring the Weld Initiator

There's one last detail we have ignored so far, and that is how Weld will detect all the beans we need for our test,
be it actual components under test such as `GreetingService` or testing infrastructure such as the `EntityManagerProducer`.
The simplest is to let Weld scan the classpath itself and pick up all beans it finds.
This is enabled by passing a new `Weld` instance to the `WeldInitiator` rule:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class CdiJpaTest {

    @Rule
    public WeldInitiator weld = WeldInitiator.from(new Weld())
        .activate(RequestScoped.class)
        .inject(this)
        .build();

    @Test
    public void someTest() {
        // ...
    }
}
----

That's very convenient, but it might cause some slowness for larger classpaths.
So alternatively, all bean types to be used during the test can be passed explicitly:

[source,java]
----
@Rule
public WeldInitiator weld = WeldInitiator.from(
        GreetingService.class,
        TransactionalGreetingService.class,
        EntityManagerProducer.class,
        EntityManagerFactoryProducer.class,
        TransactionExtension.class,
        // ...
    )
    .activate(RequestScoped.class)
    .inject(this)
    .build();
----

This avoids the classpath scanning but comes at the cost of increased efforts for writing and maintaining the test.
My recommendation would be to go for the classpath scanning approach and only switch over to explicitly listing all classes if the scanning actually isn't feasible.

== Summary

In this post we've explored how to test the CDI beans of an application in conjunction with the JPA-based persistence layer in a plain Java SE environment.
This can be an interesting middle-ground for certain tests, where you'd like to go beyond testing individual classes in complete isolation,
but at the same time are shying away from running full-blown integration tests in a Java EE (or should I say, Jakarta EE) container.

Is this to say that all tests of an enterprise application should be implemented in the described way?
Certainly not.
Oftentimes pure unit tests are a great choice in order to assert the correct functioning of a single class.
Also complete integration tests make lots of sense to ensure that all the pieces and layers of an application work correctly together,
from top to bottom.
But the suggested alternative can be a very useful tool in the box to ensure correct interaction of business logic and persistence layer without incurring the overhead of container deployments,
amongst other things testing correct transactional behaviour, transactional observer methods and entity listeners using CDI services.

That being said, it'd be desirable if much less glue code was needed in order to realize these tests.
I've opened https://github.com/weld/weld-junit/issues/65[a ticket] in the Weld JUnit project,
discussing the idea of adding a separate JPA/JTA module to the project,
which would largely simplify the set-up.
If you're interested in this or perhaps even would like to work on this, make sure to get in touch with the Weld team.
