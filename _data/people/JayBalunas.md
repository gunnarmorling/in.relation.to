I'm a JBoss core developer at Red Hat, and the AeroGear project lead. I
previously lead the RichFaces project, and have been involved in many other open
source projects such as Seam, and JBoss AS. I'm passionate about promoting open
source, community, and standards. I server as a W3C representative for Red Hat,
and have been part of multiple Java Community Process (JCP) specifications,
currently on the JSON API expert group. I have been architecting and developing
enterprise applications and projects for over fourteen years, specializing in
mobile device integration, web tier frameworks, UI design, and integration.
