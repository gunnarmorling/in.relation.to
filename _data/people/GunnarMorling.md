I am member of the Hibernate Team at Red Hat, primarily working on
[Hibernate OGM](http://hibernate.org/ogm/),
[Hibernate Validator](http://hibernate.org/validator/) and
[Hibernate Search](http://hibernate.org/Search/). I'm also serving in the
[JSR 349](http://beanvalidation.org/) expert group (Bean Validation).

In my spare time I lead the [MapStruct](http://mapstruct.org/) project, a
code generator for bean to bean mappings.
