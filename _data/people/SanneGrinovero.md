I'm working in the Hibernate and Infinispan teams at JBoss, caring about Lucene
integration in products we support, striving to make it easier to use and to
integrate in well known APIs and patterns, and finally to make it scale better;
I love clean and well performing code.
I've been an early adopter of cloud deployments scaling Lucene to a huge number
of requests on EC2 using Hibernate Search, and after that I worked with
Sourcesense to make JIRA clusterable via Infinispan. Have been trainer on Seam
and Hibernate courses.
